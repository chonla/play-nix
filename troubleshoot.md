## Ruby version conflict

I have run into a conflict of ruby versions serveral times. I am using macOS with rbenv installed. This is what I tried to resolve the conflict, yes, it is starting over.

    1. [Uninstall nix](./uninstall_nix.md)
    2. Uninstall unused versions of ruby in rbenv
    3. Uninstall all unused gems
    4. Reinstall bundlers
    5. [Reinstall nix](./install_nix.md)
