# Play nix

I am playing [nix](https://nixos.org/). This is the simple steps using nix.

## Environment

* Nix
* Flakes

## Why

I know nix when I was in a class of LeSS in Action 2024, Bangkok. I think it should be f* great if we, a team, can controlled the environment that we use in development, even we use the different platforms. I do not know if nix is built for that, but it is from my perspective.

## Get started

1. [Install nix](./install_nix.md)
2. [Create flake](./create_flake.md)
3. [Enable flake](./enable_flake.md)
4. [Nix development shell with flake](./nix_dev_with_flake.md)

These steps are good enough version of use for me. Hope this help you too.
